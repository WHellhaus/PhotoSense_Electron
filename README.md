# PhotoSense

PhotoSense is a tool to automatically censor faces in photos of protests, using openCV's DNN for face detection and a custom U-Net model for pixel segmentation. A working demo can be seen at www.photosense.app. This repository is for the Desktop application built using Electron. Initial boilerplate was forked from https://github.com/reZach/secure-electron-template.
